{% if nginx %}=============================
NGINX:
=============================
The nginx config file in this directory should work for most basic setups.
Do not edit it unless you know what you are doing.  If you do edit it, you
will need to issue nginx a reload command like so:

restart_server nginx

{% endif %}{% if apache %}
============================
Apache:
============================
The apache config file in this directory should work for most basic setups.
Do not edit it unless you know what you are doing.  If you do edit it, you
will need to issue apache a reload command like so:

restart_server apache

{% endif %}{% if uwsgi_version %}=============================
uWSGI:
=============================
You can specify which version of python you're using in the nginx config file
by replacing {{uwsgi_version}} with the respective version of python you need.
Currently we support uwsgi25 and uwsgi27 with uwsgi32 planned for the future.
uWSGI should automatically reload when it detects changes in the project repo.
If it does not reload, you can restart it manually by typing:

restart_server {{uwsgi_version}}

{% endif %}=============================
The Virtual Environment:
=============================
The virtualenv has been created in the 'env' folder with python{{py_version}}.
If you need a different version of python, feel free to remove it and re-create
it.  The following command should work nicely:

rm -rf env
virtualenv --distribute --no-site-packages --python=python2.x env

You can source into your virtualenv with the following command:

source env/bin/activate

Once you're sourced into the virtualenv, any command you use will look first
in the env/bin folder for the binary.  pip will also install into the virtualenv
directly instead of installing packages system-wide.  DO NOT RUN PIP IF YOU ARE
NOT SOURCED INTO A VIRTUALENV.

=============================
The Project:
=============================
Please place your project directly inside the env directory, like so:

cd env
hg clone http://source.{{project}}.bixly.com {{project}}
